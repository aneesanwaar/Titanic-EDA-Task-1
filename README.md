Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze patterns in passenger survival, visualize key insights, and preprocess the data for potential machine learning applications.

Dataset
The dataset consists of:
1.train.csv: Training dataset containing labeled survival data.
2.test.csv: Test dataset without survival labels.

Project Steps
1. Loading the Data: Read the dataset using Pandas.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and incorrect data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Statistical summary of features.
    - Visualization of distributions and relationships.
    - Boxplots and histograms for key variables.
4. Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features if necessary.
5. Observations: Insights from data analysis.

How to Run the Scripts
1. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   
2. Open and run "Titanic EDA.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook:
   
   jupyter notebook "Titanic EDA.ipynb"
   

Observations
 1. Most passengers with higher fares had better survival rates.
 2. Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
 3. Passengers in first-class survived more than those in lower classes.
 4. Age played a role in survival, with younger passengers having better chances.

Conclusion
EDA on the Titanic dataset provides important insights into survival patterns, which can help in building predictive models in the future. Further analysis could include feature selection and machine learning model implementation.
